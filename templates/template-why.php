        <p> As a virtual research environment, openVRE aims to integrate tools and 
        pipelines to enforce a research community. To this end, we are offering you the 
        possibility to integrate your application in our platform, if you think it could 
        fit in it. We encourage you to read though this documentation and contact us for 
        any doubt or suggestion you may have. </p>
